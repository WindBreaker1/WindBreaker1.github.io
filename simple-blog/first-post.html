    <h1>Re-organizing Knowledge and Productivity Systems</h1>
    <p>Re-organizing such a system is a symptom of high-level procrastination.</p>
    <p>It is high-level because the person involved in such procrastination isn&#39;t smoking weed or scrolling social media.</p>
    <p>They are actually attempting to do a good thing, but by doing it repeatedly, it loses its meaning.</p>
    <p>Ideally, a note-taking and knowledge-management system should last a lifetime. Yet a lot of people in the space are in the habit of frequent change.</p>
    <p>Most of the time, this change is unwarranted and useless to the learning process.</p>
